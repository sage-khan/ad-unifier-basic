# Test Task: Unified Ads Campaign Insights Prototype

## Scenario

You’re tasked with designing and prototyping a solution to help a marketing team better understand and manage their ads campaigns.
Currently, they run ads on multiple platforms (Google Ads, Facebook Ads, LinkedIn Ads, TikTok Ads, etc.).

The main problems:

-    Data is fragmented across tools.

-    It’s hard to compare performance across platforms.

-    Defining meaningful KPIs is tricky.

-    Decisions are often made with incomplete information.

## Your Challenge

In this task, you will act as software engineer, product owner, and solution architect to propose and prototype a solution.

## Deliverables

### Problem Understanding & Product Thinking (Product Owner hat, You write it not AI)

-    In your own words, describe the challenges marketers face in managing fragmented ad campaigns.

-    Propose 2–3 core KPIs you think would be most valuable for decision-making.

-    Suggest one “smart” feature (e.g., anomaly detection, AI-based recommendation, data unification approach).

### System & Data Architecture Proposal (Architect hat, You write it not AI)

Sketch (or describe) a simple architecture for how your system would:

-    Collect or simulate data from multiple ad platforms.

-    Store & normalize it.

-    Expose insights to the user (dashboard, reports, etc.).

-    Keep it lightweight (you don’t need production-ready details).

### Rapid Prototype (Software Engineer + AI skills) - (Spoiler we know that AI is game changer, you are not asked to write the code, you are asked to deliver the code, you can fully leverage AI tools, although together with code you need to deliver all used prompts, detail explanation of used tools and reasoning behind them)

Implement a small prototype (Python, JS, or any language you like) that:

-    Uses mock or synthetic data (you don’t need real API calls).

-    Normalizes data from at least 2 different “platforms” (could just be CSV/JSON files with different formats).

-    Calculates your proposed KPIs.

-    Optionally uses a basic AI technique (e.g., trend analysis, anomaly detection, clustering, or even GPT to generate a summary of results).

### Output (You write it, not AI)

Provide a short README or brief document explaining:

-    Your thought process.

-    How you’d extend the prototype into a more complete product.

-    Trade-offs you considered.
